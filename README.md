phpenv-virtualenv
=================

Multiple virtual environments for PHP releases.

While phpenv facilitates the building and switching of multiple PHP releases, phpenv-virtualenv as inspired by [virtualenv](http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/) of Python fame, will facilitate multiple isolated PHP environments per PHP release.

Call to arms
------------

As phpenv is branched from the parent project rbenv, to enable merging back of enhancements happening upstream so too we envision this clone would branche from either the official [virtualenv](https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv) although we may find another active project [pyenv-virtualenv](https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv-virtualenv) more suited as a plugin to phpenv pending further investigation.

We are accepting pull requests, comments, suggestions, motivations or any contributions you think can help realise this useful addition to the phpenv family.
